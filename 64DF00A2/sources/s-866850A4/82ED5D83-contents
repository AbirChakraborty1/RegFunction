\title{
Custom function for  regression by decision tree.
}
\description{
This function takes training data, tesing data, target variable and predict target variable of the training data}
\usage{
tree_func(train, test, target, drop = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{train}{
Training Data as a dataframe.
}
\item{test}{
Testing Data as a dataframe.
}
\item{target}{
Name of the variable where probability score needs to be predicted
}
\item{drop}{
Name of the variable that needs to be dropped before building the model.
}
}
\details{
This is a custom function for  regression by decision tree, it builds a tree model first on the training data.

The argument 'drop' removes the variables not needed to build the model.

The remaining variables are used to make the final tree model and predict the target variable on the training data.}
\value{
The value returns from this function is a numeric vector.
