\title{
Custom function for regression by Gradient Boosting Machine
}
\description{
This function takes training data, tesing data, target variable, tuning parameters, and predict target variable of the training data by GBM regression model.
}
\usage{
gbm_reg(train,test,target,
drop = NULL,num_trials=10,
interaction.depth=c(1:7),
n.trees=c(50,100,200,500,700),
shrinkage=c(.1,.01,.001),
n.minobsinnode=c(1,2,5,10),
type='NULL')
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{train}{
Training Data as a dataframe.
}
\item{test}{
Testing Data as a dataframe.
}
\item{target}{
Name of the variable that needs to predict
}
\item{drop}{
Name of the variable that needs to be dropped before building the model.
}
\item{num_trials}{
Total number of trails to find best  combination of GBM parameters causing minimum error
}
\item{interaction.depth}{GBM Tuning parameter: Integer specifying the maximum depth of each tree (i.e., the highest level of variable interactions allowed). A value of 1 implies an additive model, a value of 2 implies a model with up to 2-way interactions, etc. Default is c(1:7)}

\item{n.trees}{GBM Tuning parameter: Integer specifying the total number of trees to fit. This is equivalent to the number of iterations and the number of basis functions in the additive expansion. Default is c(50,100,200,500,700).
}
\item{shrinkage}{
GBM Tuning parameter: a shrinkage parameter applied to each tree in the expansion. Also known as the learning rate or step-size reduction; 0.001 to 0.1 usually work, but a smaller learning rate typically requires more trees. Default is c(.1,.01,.001)}

\item{minobsinnode}{
GBM Tuning parameter: Integer specifying the minimum number of observations in the terminal nodes of the trees. Note that this is the actual number of observations, not the total weight.Default is c(1,2,5,10)
}
\item{type}{
if type = "tuning", it will return the least error with best value of the best parameter combination,any other value will return the prediction on testing data.
}
}
\value{
The value returns from this function is a numeric vector.
